Configuring your Go application to start sending telemetry to Scout is easy and straightforward.
All you need is your Scout ID, which you can find in your Scout dashboard.

Although Scout offers so much more, this quickstart guide will focus on the basics: setting you up in one minute or less.

For an in-depth exploration of the Scout Go SDK, including middleware for popular libraries like **Fiber** and **Gorilla Mux**, check out our <InternalLink>Go SDK documentation</InternalLink>.

## Usage

### Require package:

```
go get github.com/scout-inc/scout-go
```

### In your entrypoint function, initialise Scout:
(This is usually `main`)

```go
import (
    "github.com/scout-inc/scout-go"
    scoutLog "github.com/scout-inc/scout-go/log"

    // we work closely with logrus
    // it's incredibly easy to integrate with any application
    log "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
)

var (
    scoutID     = os.Getenv("SCOUT_PROJECT_ID")
    environment = os.Getenv("ENVIRONMENT")
    gitSha      = os.Getenv("GIT_SHA")
)

func main() {
    // some code

    // configure Scout
    scout.Init(
		scout.WithProjectID(scoutID),
		scout.WithEnvironment(environment),
		scout.WithServiceName("orders-service"),
		scout.WithServiceVersion(gitSha), // this is not strictly necessary, but it's good practice
	)
	defer scout.Stop()

    // some code
}
```

### Add logging instrumentation in one line

```go
func main() {
    // Scout configuration above...

    // Init() instructs Scout to start collecting logs
    scoutLog.Init()

    // some code
}
```

### Log as usual

```go
func DoSomethingGreat() {
    // some code

    log.Info("Did something great")
}
```

<QuickLink id='errors' text='Errors' />

### Errors

Record errors using `scout.RecordError()`:

```go
func HandlePayment(ctx context.Context) {
    // some code

    scout.RecordError(ctx, errors.New("Insufficient wallet balance"))
}
```
