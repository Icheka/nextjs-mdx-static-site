We recommending integrating the Scout Chi middleware in your Chi applications.

The Chi middleware will record key attributes for your API requests (such as client IPs and status codes).

<ScoutInitialisationWarning language='Go' />

1. If your backend exposes APIs to your frontend application, start by initialising Scout in your **frontend** with the following configuration:

```javascript
const SCOUT_PROJECT_ID = process.env.SCOUT_PROJECT_ID

Scout.init(SCOUT_PROJECT_ID, {
  // any backend deployments should go here
  tracingOrigins: ['localhost', 'your-app.com/backend'],
  networkRecording: {
    enabled: true,
    recordHeadersAndBody: true,
  },
  // ... extra Scout configs
})
```

2. Configure Scout in your **Chi** backend:

```go
func main() {
    scout.Init(
        ...
    )
    defer scout.Stop()
}
```

3. Integrate the go-chi middleware:

```go
import (
    ...
    scoutChi "github.com/scout-inc/scout-go/middleware/chi"
)

func main() {
    // ...
    r := chi.NewRouter()
    r.Use(scoutChi.Middleware)
    // ...
}
```
