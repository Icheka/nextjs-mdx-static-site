    Scout's Go SDK fully supports reporting metrics, events, logs and traces (MELT).

<QuickLink text='Install' />
### Install

```
go get github.com/scout-inc/scout-go
```
<QuickLink text='Import' />
### Import 

```go
import "github.com/scout-inc/scout-go"
```

<QuickLink text='Initialise' />
### Initialise

Ideally, you should initialise Scout as early as possible. The app's entrypoint (`main`) is usually the best place to.

You can find your unique **Scout ID** in your Project dashboard.

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/scout-inc/scout-go"
    scoutLog "github.com/scout-inc/scout-go/log"
    log "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
)

var (
    scoutID     = os.Getenv("SCOUT_PROJECT_ID")
    environment = os.Getenv("ENVIRONMENT")
    gitSha      = os.Getenv("GIT_SHA")
    serviceName = "payments-service"
)

func main() {
    scout.Init(
		scout.WithProjectID(scoutID),
		scout.WithEnvironment(environment),
		scout.WithServiceName(serviceName),
		scout.WithServiceVersion(gitSha), // this is not strictly necessary, but it's good practice
	)
	defer scout.Stop()

    // report logs
    scoutLog.Init()
}
```

<QuickLink text='Verify' />
### Verify

Verify that everything was set up properly and is working by inspecting the <ExternalLink href='https://app.scout.dev/errors'>Errors</ExternalLink> and <ExternalLink href='https://app.scout.dev/logs'>Logs</ExternalLink> tabs of your Scout dashboard for telemetry.

Scout will automatically collect logs and panics throughout your app. To report errors, use the `scout.RecordError` method.

Add the following snippet immediately below your Scout configuration and run your application to test quickly.

```go
func main() {
    // Scout configuration...

    log.Info("Looking good!")

    ctx := context.TODO() // create a context reference if you do not already have one
    err := errors.New("Testing Scout")
    scout.RecordError(ctx, err)
}
```
