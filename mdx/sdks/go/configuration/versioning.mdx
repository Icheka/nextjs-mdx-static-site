<ScoutInitialisationWarning language='Go' />

A release is a version of your service (identified by `scout.WithServiceName`) that is deployed to an environment (identified by `scout.WithEnvironment`).

We recommend configuring Scout with your release/version information. Doing so enables you to:

- Track down and identify which commit introduced an issue.
- Evaluate the health of a new release by comparing error metrics with metrics for older releases.

## Configuring Scout with Versioning

Although your release/version ID is arbitrary and completely up to you, we recommend adopting one of these strategies:

1. **Git Commit SHA:** You can inject your commit SHA as a runtime environment variable and retrieve this value as part of the initialisation step:
```go
func main() {
    scout.Init(
        scout.WithProjectID(os.Getenv("SCOUT_PROJECT_ID))
        scout.WithServiceName("iam-service"),
		scout.WithServiceVersion(os.Getenv("GIT_COMMIT_SHA")),
        // extra configuration
    )
    defer scout.Stop()
}
```
2. **Semantic Versioning:** These are version IDs that follow the format: _**major_version.minor_version.patch_version.release_version.pre-release_version**_.
Only the **major** version number is required for a version ID to be considered semantic. See <ExternalLink href='https://semver.org'>https://semver.org</ExternalLink> for more information.
