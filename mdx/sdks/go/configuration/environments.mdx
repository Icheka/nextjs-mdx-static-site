Scout allows you to tag events to the environment they are associated with. Whether you are running a production app, or on a staging server, you can tag environments using the `scout.WithEnvironment` configuration function.

<ScoutInitialisationWarning language='Go' />

```go
var (
    scoutID     = os.Getenv("SCOUT_PROJECT_ID")
    environment = os.Getenv("ENVIRONMENT")
)

func main() {
    // Configure Scout
    scout.Init(
        scout.WithProjectID(scoutID),
		scout.WithEnvironment(environment),
        // extra configuration
    )
}
```

Scout automatically creates new environments with the value passed to `scout.WithEnvironment`, so arbitrary environments like "john-local" will work too.

```go
var (
    scoutID     = os.Getenv("SCOUT_PROJECT_ID")
    environment = os.Getenv("ENVIRONMENT")
)

func main() {
    if environment == "local" {
		user, err := user.Current()
		if err != nil {
			panic("Failed to retrieve current user")
		}

		username := user.Username
		environment = fmt.Sprintf("%s-local", username)
	}

    // Configure Scout
    scout.Init(
        scout.WithProjectID(scoutID),
		scout.WithEnvironment(environment),
        // extra configuration
    )
    defer scout.Stop()
}
```

We recommend creating separate environments with different <InternalLink href='/sdks/go/configuration/sampling'>sampling configurations</InternalLink>. Doing this can help you effectively manage your usage and minimise your Scout bills.

Environments cannot be deleted but any number of environments can be created in a project.
